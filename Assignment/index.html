                    <b>About</b><br>
                    Monkeys are sick. If you get a really fat one maybe a gorilla it can probably be your bodyguard or something. 
                    Imagine walking around having that absolute unit of an animal just by your side ready to square up whenever someone comes at you. 
                    Would be insane... unless? You'd be the absolute KING of the streets with a pet like that. I'd love that. Honestly 
                    maybe in the future we'll get there and everyone can have their own pet gorilla without worrying about jail or anything.
                    As long as you're treating it well and feeding it, I feel like there really isn't any issue. If you turn that boy into Caesar
                    from Planet of The Apes then you're good. That boy will be able to do anything he puts his mind into.

                    <b>Caretaking</b><br>
                    Look, if you're gonna own a monkey you better know how to take care of it. First of all you should never feed them drugs becuase if they become too smart
                    then you run the risk of the simian flu getting out and the whole world being put into lockdown (again lmaoo). You can, however, get your little dude a fresh cut or
                    something to make him feel like the king he was born to be. Ask your barber for a skin fade and your little ape will have the time of his life. Might have to get that 
                    little guy neutered so he doesn't end up having like 20 kids and naming them all George Foreman. That guy has at least like 5 kids all named George # whatever and has a daughter
                    named Georgina. Absolutely insane. That guy is still crazy rich so who can really judge. I mean there's a kid out there named Stormy. Wild stuff.
